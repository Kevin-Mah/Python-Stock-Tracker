Python Stock Tracker

This is a simple stock tracker that I have been working on to refresh my memory on python and visual studio.
The tracker is run through the command prompt and and outputs daily stock information of the specific stock.
This app uses the www.alphavantage.co stock API

Currently still working out some bugs.
